# Overview

This section provides step-by-step tutorials to help you get hands-on experience with the Cloud-Native IoT platform. Whether you're onboarding your first device, deploying firmware updates, or integrating with Kubernetes-native tools, these guides are designed to walk you through practical workflows in real-world scenarios.

Each tutorial focuses on a specific component or use case, with detailed instructions, commands, and expected outcomes. These examples are ideal for developers, operators, and system integrators looking to understand the inner workings of the platform.

What you'll find here:
- [Platform Setup](setup.md): Learn how to deploy and configure platform components using containers or Kubernetes manifests.
- [Secure Boot](secure-boot.md): Setup ESP32 devices with Secure Boot (v1).
- [Secure Boot v2](secure-boot-v2.md): Setup ESP32 devices with Secure Boot (v2).
- [Initial device flash](esp32-initial.md): Flash a vanilla device.
- [Device Onboarding](onboarding.md): Securely register ESP32 and Linux-based devices using DICE attestation.
- [OTA Firmware Updates](ota-update.md): Deploy new firmware builds over-the-air, with integrity checks and rollback support.
- [Akri Discovery Integration](akri-esp32.md): Discover and manage devices dynamically in a Kubernetes cluster.
- [Advanced Scenarios](vaccel.md): Offload compute to edge accelerators.

- [End-to-end](e2e.md) Scenario: Covering all the above steps. 

> **Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes is recommended.
