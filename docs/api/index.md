# Overview

The Cloud-Native IoT platform exposes a set of RESTful APIs designed to facilitate secure device onboarding, firmware updates, and device discovery through Akri. These endpoints are structured to support both microcontroller-class (e.g., ESP32) and Linux-class devices across the edgeâ€“cloud continuum.

This section provides a detailed look at two core API groups:

- [Device API](openapi-spec.md)
  The Device API handles the lifecycle of IoT devices within the platform. From onboarding to firmware updates, these endpoints are responsible for ensuring secure and seamless device interactions.
