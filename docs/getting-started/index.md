# Overview

Whether you're integrating ESP32 microcontrollers or Linux-based devices, our platform facilitates zero-touch provisioning using DICE-based attestation, ensuring device authenticity from the outset. With Akri-based device discovery, you can automatically detect and register devices, creating an up-to-date inventory without manual intervention.

For developers and system integrators, the platform offers:

- Secure Device Onboarding: Leverage DICE-based mechanisms to authenticate devices during the provisioning process.
- Seamless OTA Updates: Deploy firmware updates effortlessly to both microcontroller and Linux-class devices.
- Dynamic Resource Discovery: Utilize Akri to automatically discover and manage connected devices within your network.
- Task Offloading: Enhance performance by offloading compute-intensive tasks to heterogeneous accelerators using vAccel.
- Kubernetes Integration: Manage and scale your IoT deployments using Kubernetes-native tools, including Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators.
